    "Let us now compute the predictions on the test set, using the $\\textbf{predict}$ and $\\textbf{predict_forces}$ methods of the KRR class. At this point we need to compute the SOAP representation of the test set structures. It is important to stress however that this will not cause any issue regarding memory usage, because all we need is the predictions, so we can compute the managers of the test set structures one by one and calculate the predictions right away. Instead for the GAP fitting we need to store ALL the structural managers of the training set to perform the regression (which causes a large RAM usage)."

    "Now we are going to use the fitted model to perform a simple NVT simulation at $\\text{T} = 10\\,$K using the i-Pi interface with librascal. For that we will use a Librascal python driver of the feat/ipi branch (in the \\scripts folder): this will create a communication socket with i-Pi, which basically receives as input a structure and returns energies, forces and stresses by means of the $\\textbf{IPICalculator}$ class of Librascal. \n",

    "The job itsself will generate a parent process (i-Pi) which contains information of the ensemble, the step needed for the time-integration, the thermostat characteristics, and all other trajectory-related infos. All these information are initially stored in an input.xml file as specified in the i-Pi documentation at https://github.com/cosmo-epfl/i-pi and given as inputs to i-Pi. The Librascal driver is then launched as a child process and exchanges information with the MD driver.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Check the .xml file in this folder to quickly read the relevant information about the MD settings. Importantly, the $\\text{<properties>}$ tag gives you information about the physical properties that are printed out by i-Pi. This simulation gives as output a .out file containing the time-evolution of all the relevant physical quantities, while the .xc.xyz file contains the full trajectory, which you can later visualize with VMD. The file $\\textbf{BaTiO3_cubic_3x3x3.xyz}$ is both used by i-Pi as a starting configuration of the trajectory and by Librascal as a template to load information about chemical species and number of atoms per species of the system. It represents a 3x3x3 pristine cubic structure with a total of $135$ atoms.\n",
